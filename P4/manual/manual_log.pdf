# Manual Implementation Log
## Article Sharing Web App – EECS 677 Project 4

This document summarizes the features implemented in the manually coded version of the Article Sharing Web App and the features that were not completed due to the 20-hour development cap.

---

# 1. Overview

The manual implementation consists of a Node.js/Express backend connected to a React + Vite frontend. All user accounts, authentication logic, and article storage are handled locally using a SQLite database. The application meets the core assignment requirements:

- Users can register, log in, and remain authenticated using JWT.
- Authenticated users can post article URLs.
- Users can delete only their own articles.
- An automatically seeded admin account can delete any article.
- Article data persists across runs through SQLite.

# 2. Implemented Features

## Backend (Node.js + Express + SQLite)

### Database
- SQLite database (`article_share.db`) auto-created on startup.
- Tables created automatically:
  - `users`
  - `articles`
- Admin account created automatically:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin`

### Authentication
- User registration endpoint  
  (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- User login endpoint  
  (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- Password hashing using **bcrypt**
- Token-based authentication using **JWT**
- Middleware to validate JWT on protected routes

### Article Functionality
- Create a new article  
  (`POST /api/articles`)
- View all articles  
  (`GET /api/articles`)
- Delete an article  
  (`DELETE /api/articles/:id`)
- Authorization rules:
  - A normal user may delete **only their own** posts
  - Admin may delete **any** post

### Security Practices
- Passwords never stored in plaintext
- Authentication enforced on write/delete operations
- Role-based access control
- Basic input validation (missing fields, invalid URLs)

---

## 2 Frontend (React + Vite)

The frontend is intentionally simple and minimalistic, as permitted by the assignment.

### Main Features
- Login UI
- Register UI
- LocalStorage used to save/restore JWT tokens
- Form to post a new article
- List of all articles
- Delete buttons for authenticated users

### Interaction With Backend
- Fetches all articles from `/api/articles`
- Sends login and register requests to `/api/auth/*`
- Sends authenticated article creation and deletion requests using `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### UI Design Choices
- No styling libraries
- Inline, minimal styles
- Single-file React implementation (`App.jsx`)
- Simple "college-project-level" functionality

---

# 3. Features Not Implemented 

The following items were identified as desirable improvements but not required by the assignment. These were not implemented due to the 20-hour cap:

### Frontend Styling / UX
- No responsive layout
- No CSS frameworks
- No page routing or multi-page layout
- No advanced error/success UI

### Account Management
- No password reset flow
- No email verification
- No profile page
- No logout timer or token refresh logic

### Article Enhancements
- No pagination or infinite scroll
- No article metadata extraction (title scraping)
- No editing of existing articles

### Security Hardening
- No rate limiting
- No CSRF protection (not needed for local dev)
- No environment-based config switching

### Deployment
- No Dockerfile
- No production bundling of frontend + backend
- Not deployed to any hosting platform (local-only as required)

---

# 4. Conclusion

The manual implementation satisfies all essential functional requirements of the Article Sharing Web App:

- Persistent data storage  
- Secure login and account creation  
- Posting and deleting articles  
- Admin-level delete permissions  
- A functioning frontend interface  

All core features operate correctly and the project is structured properly.
